  <h1>MEET OUR TEAM MEMBERS</h1><br>
  <p>We worked on this design sprint for 3 weeks. We interviewed some users, surveyed some people to discover the problem. We found that the biggest problem we are trying to solve is to solve the issue of financial illiteracy, through educating young people have a lot of real life questions that aren't really being addressed enough by the school system. We aim to educate them in an entertaining manner to raise awareness and make communities talk about this issue.</p><br><br>
